This directory serves the functionality, through the Main class, of sorting any user inputted list of email contacts, and sorts them 
based on domain order.

In order to successfully run this program, you will need to personally input the list of emails you want to sort one line at a time 
in the input.txt file.  Then, you should run the command "java Main.java input.txt output.txt" so that the program will validate every
email you have inputted, sort them based on domain, sort them within each domain, then output the emails in sorted order one line at a 
time to the output.txt file.  The commands may be different depending on the terminal you use (may need to use the javac command before 
the java command, but my current IDE compiles and runs with just the java command).
